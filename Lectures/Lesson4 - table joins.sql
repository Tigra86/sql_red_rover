left (table1) or right (table2) table records.*/
/* there is no full join in MySQL -- this sql below doesn't work
select * 
from mywork.emp e

-- same as this union 
select *

union
select * 
from mywork.emp e
right join mywork.dept d on e.dept = d.deptno;

-- self join 
/*A self-join joins data from the same table. In other words, it joins a table with itself. 
Records taken from the table are matched to other records from the same table. 
Why would you do this? You may need to compare a value with another value from the same row. 
You can’t do that unless you join the table to itself and compare the values as if 
they were in two separate records.
